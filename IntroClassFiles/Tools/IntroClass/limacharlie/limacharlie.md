In this lab we will be using **LimaCharlie** to investigate endpoint monitoring and threat detection.

What is Lima Charlie? Lima Charlie is a lightweight browser based tool, it helps keep an eye on systems, detect threats, and responds quickly to any suspicious activity.  This walkthrough will be using the chrome browser, however any browser can be used.

Lets open a browser window. 

Once the window is up, navigate to the following URL:
